			Hello, My name is Chanho Chun. I am an 3rd year student at Essec Business School. I'm from <strong>South Korea</strong> and I love to play sports, meet new people, and in general just make new memories with my friends. I have chosen to listen to the Web Development course because I am interested in leveraging technology and ai tools. Welcome to my page.

			<h2>Youtube

			<p>
			I also love to watch <strong>Youtube</strong> on my free time because it makes me feel relaxed. Time seems to just pass by and being able to watch videos related to my interest is always interesting. There are endless amounts of information on Youtube and these days I think it's one of the most reliable source to enjoy your time and find interesting information.

			<h2>Relaxing
			<i class="fa-solid fa-mug-saucer"></i></h2>		
			<p>
			In general I  just like to mostly relax and chill at the house. With my friends I do go out often to go grab dinenr together or hang out but I mostly enjoy staying home because of how confortable I am. As someone who needs their own time, I think spending some time at home while doing the things you want is one of the ways I recover my energy.
